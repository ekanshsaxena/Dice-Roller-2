I have build this app to practice basic concepts of Android Development using Kotlin. My learning are as follows:

+ App's execution starts from the `MainActivity.kt`'s `onCreate` method.
+ Each view has resource id associated with it through which we can find it using `findViewById()` method.
+ We can position our views like _TextView_, _ImageView_, _Button_, etc through the layout panel.
+ Margins should be provided in **dp** (display independent pixels).
+ Button has `setOnClickListener` through which we can define the on click action.
+ ImageView has `setImageResource` through which we can set the required image.

### That's All
